C# port of pt: a go path tracer

PTSharpCore is a C# port of path tracer pt by Michael Fogleman (https://github.com/fogleman/pt). This port was done as part of an attempt to learn Go and to understand better the original path tracer codebase.

Getting Started:
- Visual Studio 2017 for C# 7 support
- NuGet package for NativeInterop (https://www.nuget.org/packages/NativeInterop)

My thanks go out to Michael Fogleman for his wonderful work.
